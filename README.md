# Weather and Agricultural Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a suite of interactive data visualizations developed to explore and analyze weather patterns and agricultural outputs across the United States. Using advanced visual techniques and Plotly, the project offers insights into how climatic conditions affect agricultural productivity and helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Visualizations

### Weather Analysis

1. **Temporal Weather Pattern Map**
   - **Description**: An advanced interactive map displaying layered data including wind patterns, precipitation, and temperature anomalies.
   - **Features**:
     - Timeline controls to play, pause, and navigate through different time periods.
     - Anomaly highlighting to detect significant deviations from typical weather patterns.

2. **Climate Metrics by States**
   - **Description**: A choropleth map visualizing aggregate weather data across states with enhanced interactivity.
   - **Interactivity**:
     - Hover over states to view detailed weather parameters.

3. **Scatter Plot for Weather Analysis**
   - **Description**: Displays the relationship between average temperature and total precipitation for each month within a selected state.
   - **Advanced Features**:
     - Incorporates additional layers such as cloud cover or wind speed.
     - Interactive legends and filters for specific data ranges or conditions.

### Agricultural Analysis

1. **Pie Chart on Top 5 Crop Yields by State**
   - **Functionality**: Allows selection of different states to display the top 5 crop yields.
   - **User Interaction**:
     - Clickable segments showing detailed distributions of crop yields.

2. **Effect of Sunlight on Crop Yields**
   - **Description**: A line chart correlating sunlight exposure with crop productivity, annotated to highlight key trends and anomalies.

3. **Total Production by State**
   - **Features**:
     - Dropdown menus to select states or crops, dynamically updating the display.
     - Hover details on the bar chart showing precise yield data and comparisons.

4. **Sankey Plot for Production Flow by State**
   - **Utility**: Visualizes the flow of agricultural production between states.
   - **Customization**:
     - Filters to view specific crops and their distribution paths.

### Combined Agriculture and Weather Analysis

1. **Choropleth Map on Average Crop Yield and Temperature by State**
   - **Overview**: Combines data on average crop yields and state temperatures into an integrated visualization aiding agricultural planning.
   - **Design**:
     - Dual subplots displaying respective temperature and crop yield data by state.

2. **Choropleth Map on Total Crop Yield and Temperature by State**
   - **Purpose**: Maps total crop yields alongside temperature data to analyze their interrelation.
   - **Visualization**:
     - Color-coded based on crop yields with detailed interactive features.
